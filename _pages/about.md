Guanxu (Gleason) WANG is currently pursuing a [Master of Science degree in Statistics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/statistics/) at the [School of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

Prior to this, he graduated from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.szu.edu.cn/) at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). During his undergraduate course, he majored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and Finance, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree and a Bachelor of Economics degree, respectively. Concurrently, he obtained the micro-professional certificate of actuarial science from Shenzhen University.

He conducts research in **actuarial science**, **financial mathematics** and **fintech**, including:

* **non-life insurance actuarial science**: ruin theory and ruin prediction;
* **machine learning**: approximate solutions of stochastic differential equations through the neural network.
